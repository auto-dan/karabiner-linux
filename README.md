## About
If you are going to actively work in GNOME on Linux and Aqua on macOS at the same time, you will be completely paralyzed by the significant differences in the ways shortcut keys are utilized.

I post here, my way of making keybindings of Aqua on macOS to work pretty close alike as in GNOME on Linux.
